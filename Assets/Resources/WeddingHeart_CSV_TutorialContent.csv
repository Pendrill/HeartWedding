"Hello there! Welcome to our Archive! ^^<rob>My name is Q-Ï€d_001 but you can just call me Cupid ^^<rob>I personally reviewed your application for our care initiative...<rob>I'm happy to say, I think you are a perfect fit for what we are doing here ^^<rob>Thousands of years ago we discovered another species used to inhabit this planet<rob>We set up this archive to better understand them ^^<rob>This species was quite complex showcasing a wide range of emotions.<rob>You are now a part of our care unit, helping uncover and better understand this emotion and their actions<rob>I'll get you started with your first heart!"
"I see you figured out how to unlock the heart! Nice job ^^<rob>Unlocking these hearts is the crucial part of your job<rob>As you activate more hearts, you will collect smaller hearts and discover more stories from these humans<rob>The smaller hearts are the key to finding these stories<rob>But don't fret! If you can't find more hearts, click on the ones you've already unlocked<rob>These will provide more hearts for you and help speed up the process :)<rob>The more hearts you activate, the more stories you'll discover, and the more little hearts you'll produce ^^<rob>Have fun out there ^^"
Testing the next tutorial...<rob>Looks like it is working ^^
